# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component

![Design preview for the Single price grid component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

####  This is a simple FrontEnd Mentor challenge.

Where I remembered many basics of html and css.

Some things I had forgotten, it was good to remember.

Some features such as flex-box, grid-layout and responsive layout were used.

Hope you like  :)
